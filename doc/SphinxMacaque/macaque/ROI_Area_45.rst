VLPFC (area 45a)
Area 45 is found in the caudal aspect of the convexity, back to the inferior limb of
the arcuate sulcus (Walker, 1940). Based on the comparative cytoarchitectonic
analysis in both human and nonhuman primates, Petrides and Pandya (1999,
2002) have subdivided this area into 45a and 45b, on the convexity rostral to the
arcuate sulcus and in the rostroventral bank of the sulcus, respectively (see also
Gerbella et al., 2007, for the architectonic analysis of these areas).

Architectonic delineation
Area 45a is characterized by the presence of large but less prominent pyramidal
neurons in deeper part of layer III (IIIB; see red arrow-heads in Fig. C on the left);
poorly defined layer II; well developed layer IV; and densely populated small and
medium sized pyramidal neurons in layer V (See also Walker, 1940; Petrides and
Pandya, 1999, 2002; Gerbella et al., 2007; Petrides et al., 2012).
Connections

Intrinsic connections:
It is connected with all the subdivisions of the LPFC (VLPFC, DPFC and CLPFC)
networks.

Extrinsic connections:
The major connections are with auditory related areas in the supratemporal plane
(STP), superior temporal gyrus (core, belt, parabelt, and STGr), and the dorsal
bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STSd; Petrides and Pandya 2002; Saleem
et al., 2008, 2014; Gerbella et al., 2010).

Subcortical connections:
Thalamus: (Contini et al., 2010)
Claustrum: Area 45a receives projection from rostrocaudal extent of ventral 2/3
of the claustrum (Saleem et al., 2014; e.g., their Fig. 12).
Striatum: (Ferry et al., 2000)
Amygdala: Area 45a sends feedforward projections to dorsal subdivision of
lateral nucleus (Ld), magnocellular and intermediate subdivisions of basal
nucleus (Bmc and Bi, respectively). It also receives feedback projections from
magnocellular, parvicelluar, and intermediate subdivisions of the basal nucleus
(Bmc, Bpc, Bi; Gerbella et al., 2013).

Functions
- Vocal and facial communication between monkeys.
- Recordings that seem to correspond to 45a have found convergent of visual
and auditory stimuli in individual neurons; the auditory responses were
particularly to species-specific calls (Sugihara et al., 2006; Romanski, 2012).
- Visual responses to face stimuli have also been found (Wilson et al., 1993;
O'Scalaidhe et al., 1997; Tsao et al., 2008b).

Homologue area in human
Area 45a (also 45b and 44) may be a precursor for the language related areas
found in the caudal ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in humans (Kelly et al., 2010;
Petrides et al., 2012, 2014).
